# adaptive-sampling
**MIT 16.412 Advanced Lecture #6 - Adaptive Sampling Mini Pset**

This is a mini-pset repository for the class. The students assigned to this Mini Pset should work on the notebook `mini-pset-adaptive-sampling.ipynb`. We provide the following modules as utilities:

- `belief_model.py` : Wrapper of sklearn-type classifier models with visualization utils
- `gridspace.py` : Util-functions for generating world maps, training data, and plotting
- `map_truth.py` : All the global variables (problem settings, model hyperparameters, etc.)
- `tests.py` : All the test functions

We also provide a tutorial `Tutorial.pdf` that describes more in detail about adaptive sampling algorithms. The students are encouraged to refer to this tutorial to better understand the concepts and actual implementations of the algorithms.
